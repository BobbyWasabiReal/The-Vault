<h1 class="sub">What is "The Vault"</h1> <br>
<p>
  Hello, and welcome to The Vault! <br> 
  The Vault is a "Safe" website (get it? Cause it's like a money safe? No? okay... :( &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), <br>
  to show off your most prized in-game possesions. You don't have any items, 
  I hear you say? Well you can always just see and review everyone's items.
  So, does your Inventory have what it takes to make it to the top of the Page?
